"""v128 -- The graded hull and the zero-mode multiplicity: E8 itself
realises the glue Q-system as a Z4-grading over the carrier (exact on all
240 roots), and the ring multiplicity p_2 = 6 is the sheet-doubled
Ginsparg-Perry zero-mode count.  [I] exact constructions; the two named
computations (R1/R2) each gain their structural anchor.

  R2 HALF -- THE HULL IS THE GRADED MODULE OF THE Q-SYSTEM.
  [I] 1. EXPLICIT COSET CONSTRUCTION.  The 240 E8 roots, built in
         D5 (+) A3 + glue coordinates, decompose over the glue group
         Z4 as
             240 = 52 + 64 + 60 + 64
         (C_0 = carrier roots 40 + 12; C_1 = (16, 4bar) from
         norm 5/4 + 3/4; C_2 = (10, 6) from 1 + 1; C_3 = (16bar, 4))
         -- exactly the v89 branching, here as explicit vectors.
  [I] 2. THE GRADING IS EXACT.  For ALL 6720 root pairs whose sum is
         again a root, coset(r1 + r2) = coset(r1) + coset(r2) mod 4:
         E8 is a Z4-GRADED Lie algebra over the carrier subalgebra,
         and the grading group IS the glue = the v125 Q-system.  The
         checksum hull is not merely 'compatible' with the Q-system --
         it is its graded module, realised in 248 dimensions.

  R1 HALF -- THE MULTIPLICITY IS THE ZERO-MODE COUNT.
  [I] 3. The Ginsparg-Perry l = 1 sector (the ZERO modes, lambda in
         {0, -1}, v104/v107) has 2l + 1 = 3 modes; sheet doubling
         (|Z2|, the double cover) gives
             2 x 3 = 6 = p_2 = |R+(A3)|
         -- the ring multiplicity of the v127 log-det clock equals the
         sheet-doubled zero-mode count.  [P] reading (recorded, not
         claimed): zero modes are exactly the modes that force a
         nonperturbative (resummed) treatment in de Sitter one-loop
         physics -- the natural home for the six RPA towers.
  [P] 4. RESIDUE: R1 = compute the RPA determinant on the six
         sheet-doubled l = 1 zero modes; R2 = identify the
         seam-Calderon inclusion with the Z4-graded structure now
         exhibited inside E8 itself.  Both computations now have their
         structural anchors fixed.
