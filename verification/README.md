# TFPT computational verification suite

Every load-bearing numerical / arithmetic claim marked **[I]** (exact identity),
**[L]** (Lie/lattice theorem) or **[N]** (numerical fixed point) in the six TFPT
documents is re-derived here from the two axioms alone:

* **P1** — the boundary seam constant `c3 = 1/(8*pi)`
* **P2** — the five-slot carrier `g_car = 5`

Everything else (E8, the SM packet, `alpha^-1`, the flavor matrix, the cascade,
gravity/cosmology, horizon readouts) is produced as a consequence and checked
against the value quoted in the papers.

## How to run

```bash
cd verification
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # or reuse an existing venv
pip install mpmath numpy sympy
python run_all.py            # runs v1..v13, exits 0 iff all pass
python v1_e8_glue.py         # any single module also runs standalone
```

Dependencies: `mpmath`, `numpy`, `sympy` for the claim suite (`run_all.py`,
`v1`..`v13`). The two helper generators need extra packages: `make_figures.py`
also needs `matplotlib` (writes `../figures/*.pdf`); `make_manifest.py` needs
only the standard library (writes `../manifest.sha256`).

## Sync infrastructure (single sources + the one audit)

All stdlib-only, runnable as plain `python3` (no venv needed); wired into
`../build.sh` (`gen` / `website` / `audit` / `release` steps):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `script_registry.csv` + `script_clusters.csv` | **Single source** for the script index — one row per `vN` (cluster, website one-liner, TeX one-liner) |
| `make_script_index.py` | Generates `../tex-artefacts/verification.tex` + `../website/components/ScriptIndex.tsx` from the registry (never edit those by hand) |
| `make_docs_map.py` | Generates `docs_map.csv` (paper → section → line range → scripts cited → last-changed date) + `website_map.csv` (mirror surfaces: website files + root `README.md` + `next.txt` → scripts/docs mentioned) + the `docs_map_dates.json` sidecar |
| `make_changelog_web.py` | Generates `../website/lib/changelog.ts` (the public `/changelog` page data) from the canonical `../changelog.tex` (never edit the `.ts` by hand) |
| `audit_sync.py` | **The** sync audit (papers ↔ suite ↔ ledger ↔ changelog ↔ website, both directions); must end `AUDIT OK` before any commit |
| `audit_baseline.json` | Frozen exceptions (grandfathered changelog ids, known integration gaps) — entries may only be *removed* |

## Script ↔ claim ↔ document map

| Script | Verifies | Referenced in |
|---|---|---|
| `v1_e8_glue.py` | **Glue theorem** `E8 = (D5⊕A3)+μ4`: `disc(D5)=disc(A3)=Z4`, `q(D5)+q(A3)=5/4+3/4=2`, `240=16·5·3`, `248=240+8` | intro, tfpt_1 (Part II), tfpt_3 |

| `v5_e8_cascade.py` | **E8 cascade spine** `D_n=60−2n`: endpoints `60,8`; exponent rungs sum `240`; IR tail product `46080=|W(D5)||W(A3)|`; variance `6552=78·84` | tfpt_3 (cascade bridge) |
| `v6_bootstrap.py` | **Self-consistency bootstrap**: reverse glue `μ²−5μ+4=0`; `g_car=5` forced three ways; `8=rank E8=h(D5)=φ(30)` | intro (back-channel), tfpt_3 (Part III) |
| `v7_gravity_cosmo.py` | **Gravity/cosmology**: scalaron exponent `7`; `M_scal²/M̄²=c3⁷` (`3.06e13 GeV`); `A_s`, `n_s`, `r`; `Ω_b`; `sin²θ12=1/3−φ0/2` | tfpt_1, tfpt_2, intro |
| `v8_horizon.py` | **Horizon readouts**: `1/(2π)=4c3`; `1920=|W(D5)|`; `S_dS=e^{2α⁻¹}/(128c3⁴)`; Page; `β_rad=φ0/4π=0.2424°` | tfpt_horizon_readouts |
| `v9_neutrino_texture.py` | **Solar angle θ₁₂**: explicit μτ-symmetric Majorana texture → `sin²θ12=1/3−φ0/2=0.30675`, `θ23=45°`, `θ13=0`; residual `ε=3φ0/4≈c3` (0.23%) | tfpt_3, tfpt_2 |
| `v10_projection_involution.py` | **Q,Σ algebra**: `K=R+QΣ`, `L=R+Q(I+Σ)`; `χ_Q=(t-1)(t²-5t+3)`, `χ_K=(t-1)(t²-8t+4)`; det ladder `(3,4,8,20)`, product `1920=|W(D5)|`; `Q±`,`K±`; `a^T K a=41` | tfpt_2 (Q,Σ section) |
| `v11_unique_KQ.py` | **Uniqueness**: `K` and `Q` are the *unique* nonneg-int matrices with their row/col sums, char.poly and monotone rows (exhaustive enumeration) | tfpt_2 |
| `v12_mass_generation_polynomials.py` | **Sector/generation polynomials** of `K` + anchor-block det ladder `(9,10,16,40)` | tfpt_2 |
| `v13_open_gates.py` | **Gate closures**: `M=41=10b1=ΣL+N_Φ`; `Q₊=A₃` exponents, `Q₋²=N_fam` | tfpt_2 |
| `v14_carrier_uniqueness.py` (A2) | **g_car=5 forced**: unique `g` with `N_fam∈Z⁺` and `g+N_fam=8`; split `(3,2)` from `b+s=5, b²+s²=13`; `Tr Y=Tr Y³=0` | tfpt_1 |
| `v15_bootstrap_classification.py` (A1) | **D5⊕A3 unique**: the only familyful cyclic-glue decomposition of E8 (16-spinor + 3 families), glue `Z4=|μ4|` | tfpt_1, tfpt_3 |
| `v16_solar_dual_anchor.py` (A3) | **Solar lemma**: `aᵀR⁻¹=aᵀL⁻¹=(-½,-½,1)`; `sin²θ12=⅓-φ0/2=0.3067`; full PMNS | tfpt_2 |
| `v17_hexagonal_resolvent.py` (A4) | **Resolvent backbone** `D_y⁻¹=(Σ y^{5-m}δ^m U₆^m)/(y⁶-δ⁶)`; quark c-digits = open `U_f*` step | tfpt_2 |
| `v18_quark_yukawa.py` (A4) | **Quark sector**: `y=λ_Y^L·Λ` reproduces source ratios (`mu/md=0.470085`, `mc/ms=13.61`, `mt/mb=40.80`) exactly + lepton `c=(16/7,4/3,7/6)`; full hierarchy; exact quark `c` need `U_f*` (open) | tfpt_2 |
| `v19_monodromy_moduli.py` (A4 deep) | **`U_f*` reduction**: exact pole `z_*=(794-7√9961)/2187` (`3⁷`); bare resolvent fails 3-11× (holonomy essential); required `Λ=(0.475,1.107,0.917)`, `Λ_μ>1`⇒non-unitary; D4-symmetric SU(3) monodromy constructible but **D4-fixed locus positive-dimensional** ⇒ exact quark `c` reduce to the `(U)` stable-point selection | tfpt_2 (H2) |
| `v20_lepton_c_derivation.py` | **Lepton c's DERIVED**: rational ⇒ from `δ=1/2` (not `δ_ph`). Non-anchor `c=\|μ4\|^w/(5/4−cos(rπ/3))` ⇒ `c_e=16/7, c_μ=4/3`; anchor via product `Π c=2^{g_car}/N_fam²=32/9` ⇒ `c_τ=7/6`. **Lepton-specific** (down sector forces `c_d/c_s=4` vs `0.94`) | tfpt_2 (leptons) |
| `v21_solar_product_quark.py` | **3 A-tasks**: solar coeff `= q(A3)=3/4` (the A3 glue-norm, `q(D5)+q(A3)=2`), `sin²θ12=1/3−φ0/2`; product `32/9=2^{g_car}/N_fam²` (full Clifford dim), `ΣL=16=dim S+`; quark non-extension (`c_c/c_s=1/7` vs `0.724`) | tfpt_2 |
| `v22_open_gates_audit.py` | **residual-gates audit contract** (A2,B3,B4,B5,B6,C7): machine-pins the exact reduction of each open gate (what is forced vs. the named residual). None closed — gates made explicit, not hidden | tfpt_2/4 |
| `v23_anchor_generator.py` | **anchor-first**: `a=(1,1,2)` → elem. sym. `(4,5,2)=(\|μ4\|,g_car,\|Z2\|)`, `c3=1/(2e₁π)`; power sums `p_n=2+2^n` → `\|R(E8)\|=240`, `dim E8=248`, binary ladder. Inputs reduce to `{a,π}` | introduction, tfpt_1 |
| `v24_quark_ratio_closure.py` | **quark RATIO closure**: `c_u/c_d=55/117`, `c_c/c_s=34/47`, `c_t/c_b=3/26` from TFPT blocks; mass ratios match `<0.03%`; rational `c` gauge, `Λ_q` in O(1) | tfpt_2 |
| `v25_frontier_conjectures.py` | **conjectures [P]**: Koide source→pole `Q_src+φ0/24≈2/3` (`\|W(A3)\|=24`); axion `f_a=M_scal/128→m_a≈23.8 μeV` | tfpt_4 |
| `v26_flavor_frontier_unification.py` | the **`11` is not uniquely forced** (≥5 readings; `55/117`=table ratio) ⇒ stays `[P]`; **unifies** the open flavor surface (c_u/c_d, Q-geometry, R-mod-(U), H2-equiv) into ONE `(U)` gate; sharpening: cusp config on the **parabolic stability wall** ⇒ polystable `∇_F*` | tfpt_2 (H2) |
| `v27_wall_representative.py` | **`(U_wall)` explicit**: balanced wall rep `W_wall` (cols=perm(0,1,2)/3, rows `w=(2,1,1)`, pardeg 0); selector `det R=8, SNF(1,1,8), Spec(Q+)={1,2,3}` ⇒ one `D4`-fixed polystable point gives `R,Q,U_f*,c_u/c_d,c_q,H2` together | tfpt_2 (H2) |
| `v28_gravity_fR.py` | **R+R² closed [I/P]**: `f(R)=R+R²/(6M²)`, `M=c3^{7/2}Mbar`=scalaron mass; `f(R)` field eq + trace; `N*=57`→`n_s=0.9649,r=0.0037,A_s=2.17e-9`; full metric measure `[A]`; `248c3²<6log(3/2)` | tfpt_2, tfpt_4 |
| `v29_research_contract_certs.py` | **research-contract certificates**: `C_U^(1)` wall enumeration (1296→144 walls→**5 orbits**, so symmetry alone does NOT pick `W_wall` — honest U1 correction); `G5` gap-dominance `2‖V‖=0.785<Δ=2.433`, `Δ_eff>1.647` | tfpt_research_contracts |
| `v30_d4_character_variety.py` | **C_U^(2)**: full `D4`-fixed `SU(3)` character variety is **positive-dimensional** (reflection does not isolate the point) ⇒ the selector must cut it, needing the `R(ρ)` parabolic↔residue dictionary (= H2) — the single remaining `(U_wall)` input | tfpt_research_contracts |
| `v31_R_dictionary.py` | **R(ρ) characterized**: case A alive (all `D4`-fixed monodromies irreducible ⇒ nontrivial mixing, U2 ≠ B); `R(ρ)` not algebraic (`R` integer, traces continuous) ⇒ it is the transcendental **non-abelian-Hodge** parabolic-degree map; `C_U^(3)` residual = the Hitchin solve | tfpt_research_contracts |
| `v32_rh_splitting.py` | **RH route (result-open)**: exponent collapse `ΣU^kA₀U^{-k}=4·diag(A₀)` exact ⇒ **splitting type made algebraic** `O(-2)⊕O(-1)²⟺diag(A₀)=(½,¼,¼)` (Schur-Horn); honest wall: `∏M_k=I` is path-ordered (not `exp`), `R`-extraction needs the H2 bridge — `c_u/c_d` not obtained (no fabrication) | tfpt_research_contracts |
| `v33_explicit_flat_bundle.py` | **explicit valid flat bundle (RH-solve output)**: hardcoded `A₀` realises cusp class + splitting `O(-2)⊕O(-1)²` + trivial ∞-monodromy `‖M_∞−I‖~1e-9` (⇒`∏M_k=I`) + **irreducible (case A)**. Existence + case A confirmed; unique `∇_F*` needs `det R=8`, `c_u/c_d` needs H2 | tfpt_research_contracts |
| `v34_h2_bridge_attempt.py` | **H2-bridge attempt (honest negative)**: explicit per-puncture `M_k` (cusp class, `∏M_k=I`); `\|diag M_k\|=(0,½,½)`, natural extraction does NOT reproduce the lepton amplitudes ⇒ the `Γ^min` geodesic-to-word dictionary is genuinely missing; `c_u/c_d` not obtained (no fabrication) | tfpt_research_contracts |

**Freeze file.** `freeze_file.csv` registers the committed kill criteria for every
falsifiable prediction (solar angle, `r`, ordering, nEDM, `w`, ...), referenced by
the introduction's *Freeze file* box.

**Blind-prediction registry (frozen 2026-06-09, machine-enforced).**
`predictions_frozen.json` freezes every *dimensionless prediction of record* at
25 significant digits **before** the next decisive data releases (JUNO
`θ12`/`θ13`, CMB-S4/LiteBIRD `r` and `β`, DESI `n_s`). `v84_frozen_registry.py`
re-derives every frozen decimal from the two axioms on each suite run, so the
formula and the frozen value are locked together: changing either alone fails
the suite, and the file itself is covered by `manifest.sha256`. The registry
also *enforces* the `θ12` freeze convention of `tfpt_2`: exactly **one**
prediction of record (`sin²θ12 = 1/3 − φ0/2 = 0.306747…`), with the seam
(`0.306808`) and non-linear (`0.307020`) values typed as derived variants of the
*same* texture — they can never silently become alternative predictions
(look-elsewhere ambiguity machine-excluded). Conditional entries carry their
hypothesis by name; `r` and `n_s` are registered as *bands* over the declared
external `N_star ∈ [50, 60]`, never as point predictions. Ledger row:
`REG.FREEZE.01`.

`tfpt_constants.py` holds the shared primitives and the `check()` harness; it is
imported by every `v*` script and by `run_all.py`. **All carrier integers
(`N_fam`, `Ω_adm`, `b1`, `dim S⁺`, `rank E8`) are now computed from `{c3, g_car}`
in `tfpt_constants.py`, not hand-assigned** (reviewer point A6).

`v1_e8_glue.py` ships an **explicit E8 lattice certificate** (reviewer point A5):
it builds all 240 roots, the Bourbaki simple-root basis, and certifies the
lattice is *even* and *unimodular* (Gram det = 1) with every root integral over
the basis — i.e. the constructed overlattice **is** E8, not just a matching of
the arithmetic tail.

## Content manifest (stable identity)

`python make_manifest.py` writes `../manifest.sha256` (sorted `sha256  path` over
the six TeX sources, the figures, and the verification suite) plus a single
*manifest digest* that is the stable content identity of the project — use this,
not the Overleaf export-zip hash, as the canonical identity (reviewer point A3).

**Release rule (v83 review finding).** The exported v83 package shipped one
stale `status_ledger.csv` manifest row because a final ledger edit happened
*after* the last manifest regeneration. Therefore: `make_manifest.py` is
always the **last** step before export, and

```bash
python make_manifest.py --check   # verifies both shipped manifests
                                  # line-by-line; exits nonzero on any
                                  # missing/stale row
```

must pass on the exported tree (ledger `REVIEW.REPRO.02`).

## Single status ledger (source of truth)

`status_ledger.csv` is the **single source of truth** for every claim: its
`claim_id` (e.g. `E8.GLU.01`, `EM.FP.01`, `QG.AMB.01`), `status`
(Axiom / Formal / Lattice / Numerical / Physical / Open), `location`,
`dependencies`, `script`, and `external_data`. The six PDFs are written against
it; if a document and the ledger ever disagree, **the ledger wins**.

## Lean provenance (the `Formal` rows)

**Shipped path.** In the reviewer package the Lean project ships at the package
root as `lean4-carrier-rigidity/`. In the source repository the same project
lives at `experiments/lean4-carrier-rigidity/`. A referee should follow the
**shipped** path; both contain identical content (toolchain
`leanprover/lean4:v4.29.1`). One command runs the hard audit gate:

```bash
cd lean4-carrier-rigidity        # source repo: experiments/lean4-carrier-rigidity
bash scripts/audit.sh            # ~7 s with cached .lake/build
```

It enforces and (this round) passes: `lake build` succeeds (1886 jobs);
no `sorry`/`admit`; no `axiom`/`constant`/`unsafe`/`opaque`/`partial`
declarations; and `#print axioms` on every headline theorem returns **only**
the three standard Lean kernel axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`,
`Quot.sound`). Use `--quick` for the static checks without a build. The full
transcript (toolchain version + `AUDIT: PASS` record) is saved at
`lean4-carrier-rigidity/AUDIT_TRANSCRIPT.txt` (reviewer point A4).

**Lean manifest.** `make_manifest.py` now also covers the Lean archive: it
writes a dedicated `lean_manifest.sha256` (sorted `sha256  relpath` over every
Lean source, `lakefile.lean`, `lake-manifest.json`, `lean-toolchain`, the audit
script and transcript) so the Lean layer has a stable content identity of its
own, separate from the TeX/Python `manifest.sha256`.

A *future* hardening target (not a blocker for the present script-certified
status): formalise the E8 lattice/glue certificate of `v1_e8_glue.py` in Lean.
Today the E8 glue is **script-certified** (240 roots, Gram evenness,
unimodularity, root integrality, glue index `Z4`); the Lean formalisation of
that certificate would be an additional, non-blocking layer.

## Status markers in the papers

`[I]` exact identity · `[L]` Lie/lattice theorem · `[F]` formalised (Lean/script)
· `[N]` numerical fixed point · `[P]` physical/conditional · `[A]` axiom/open.
Claims carrying `[I]`, `[L]` or `[N]` are the ones reproduced by this suite;
`[F]` Lean material lives in `lean4-carrier-rigidity/` (shipped) /
`experiments/lean4-carrier-rigidity/` (repo).

## Residual gates (explicitly open / conditional — do not silently promote)

The audit-visible residual gates for the current document set. Open gates stay
`[O]`, conditional gates `[C]`; none may be rendered as closed `[E]`. (The earlier
`Q`-geometry and `R`-modulo-`(U)` gates are no longer residual: the quark *ratios*
are closed combinatorially — integer Plücker, `v49`/`v71` — and `Q±` is now a
Lie/lattice result with only `det Q = N_fam` remaining.)

| Gate | Status | What is missing |
|---|---|---|
| `v_geo` (absolute scale) | `[O]` | the single dimensionless→dimensionful metrology unit; gravity's `1/G` and the flavor `U_point` anchor both reduce to it (`v68`, `v75`) |
| `G_net` / `SEAM.EQUIV.01` | `[C]` | the raw RP seam *is* the holomorphic `(E8)_1` net, closed modulo cited theorems (`v367`/`v368`, `v376`–`v379`); only the cited continuum scaling-limit existence stays `[O]` (`v336`) |
| `F_transfer` | `[C]` | the four typed transfer interfaces (`η_B`, `m_p/m_e`, exact Koide, dark-matter relic scale) — runnable solvers with kill tests (`v371`–`v375`) |
| `N_star` | `[C]` | reheating input, **not** a compiler consequence; band `[50,60]` |
| Ambient QG measure `QG.AMB.01` | `[C]` | the local covariant Einstein equation `G_ab+Λg_ab=c₃⁻¹T_ab` is parameter-free (`v359`); only the global nonperturbative measure remains, discharged as a `[C]` redundancy (`v369`/`v379`) — a certification object, not missing dynamics |
| Wolfram second path | numeric | base `116/116` + extension `303/303` independent checks in `verification/wolfram/` |

## Red Team / Stress Test layer (`redteam/`)

A **deliberately adversarial** layer that tries to *break* the five load-bearing
reductions instead of confirming them (the v78-review request). It is separate
from `run_all.py` on purpose: its checks assert adversarial facts (a
counterexample exists, a hidden assumption is needed, a firewall holds), and the
honest outcome of each target lives in a **status**, not a green pass.

```bash
cd redteam && python run_redteam.py     # runs targets A–E + writes redteam_table.txt
```

| Target | Script | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| A — (E8)₁ boundary-net identification | `redteam/rt_A_e8net.py` | reduced, not closed (`c=8` underdetermines the net; holomorphy is the missing assumption). After `v83` + `v87`: **one** residual — holomorphy+`c=8` pins both the net (`v83`) *and* the unique 2D bulk (`v87`, LR/KLM/BKLR; `SO(16)₁` counter-model admits six modular invariants) |
| B — carrier rank / Pascal condition | `redteam/rt_B_pascal.py` | survives, narrowed (arithmetic `[F]` stands; the Pascal *selection* is typed `[A]/[P]`) |
| C — `k = c₃/2` seam-area coefficient | `redteam/rt_C_kc3.py` | survives (dimensional firewall: no naked `k_phys = c₃/2`) |
| D — `U_point → v_geo` bijection | `redteam/rt_D_upoint.py` | survives, narrowed (four hypotheses made explicit; CP phases residual) |
| E — `v_geo` dimensional floor | `redteam/rt_E_vgeo.py` | survives, narrowed (floor of the certified tiers; frontier scales stay typed) |

Verdicts are recorded as ledger rows `REDTEAM.A.01 … REDTEAM.E.01` and presented
in the note `tfpt_5_redteam.tex`. See `redteam/README.md` for the full protocol.
